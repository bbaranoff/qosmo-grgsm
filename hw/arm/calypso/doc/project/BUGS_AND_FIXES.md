# C54x DSP Emulator - All Bugs and Fixes

## Session 2026-04-05 (this context)

### Bug 1: SP leak via RPTB EXIT
- **Symptom**: SP incremented +1 at each RPTB EXIT (0xe999->0xe9b0)
- **Root cause**: RPTB itself was not the issue, the SP leak came from other instructions
- **Fix**: Added SP change detector to identify culprit instructions

### Bug 2: SP corruption via STH B writing to MMR zone
- **Symptom**: SP drops from 0x5AC8 to 0x0000 at PC=0x8a46
- **Root cause**: STH B with DP=0 writes B(high)=0 to addr 0x18 = SP register (MMR)
- **Fix**: Set SP init to 0x5AC8 (Calypso boot ROM value). Later fixed properly via CALLD/RPTBD corrections.

### Bug 3: PROM1 mirror stopping at 0xFF7F
- **Symptom**: Interrupt vectors at 0xFF80-0xFFFF empty
- **Root cause**: Mirror range was `addr16 >= 0xE000 && addr16 < 0xFF80`
- **Fix**: Changed to `addr16 >= 0xE000` (include vectors)

### Bug 4: Interrupt vectors 1-7 overwritten by IDLE stubs
- **Symptom**: TINT0 and other interrupts branch to IDLE instead of real handlers
- **Root cause**: c54x_reset() installed IDLE at vec 1-7 positions, overwriting PROM1 ROM vectors
- **Fix**: Only install vec 0 (reset). Vec 1-7 come from PROM1 ROM mirror.

### Bug 5: F272 decoded as NORM instead of RPTBD
- **Symptom**: Code at 0x76FB consumed 1 word instead of 2, corrupting instruction flow
- **Root cause**: F272 = RPTBD (repeat block delayed, 2 words) per tic54x-opc.c. Was incorrectly decoded as NORM (normalize accumulator).
- **Fix**: Added specific checks for F272=RPTBD, F274=CALLD, F273=RETD before LMS handler

### Bug 6: F274 decoded as NORM instead of CALLD
- **Symptom**: Code at 0x7702 treated as normalize instead of delayed call
- **Root cause**: Same as Bug 5 - F274 is CALLD pmad (delayed call, 2 words)
- **Fix**: F274 now pushes PC+2 and branches to pmad

### Bug 7: Indirect addressing modes 0xC-0xF not consuming 2nd word
- **Symptom**: Instructions with `*(lk)`, `*+ARn(lk)`, `*ARn(lk)`, `*+ARn(lk)%` used AR as address without offset, and the offset word was executed as next instruction
- **Root cause**: resolve_smem had `/* handled by caller */` for modes C-F but no caller actually handled them
- **Fix**: resolve_smem now reads prog_fetch(s, s->pc+1) for modes C-F, sets s->lk_used=true. All `return consumed` changed to `return consumed + s->lk_used`.

### Bug 8: BANZ testing old AR value
- **Symptom**: BANZ at 0xB36B branching incorrectly
- **Root cause**: Code saved `old_arp_val = s->ar[arp(s)]` BEFORE resolve_smem modified AR, then tested old value
- **Fix**: Test `s->ar[arp(s)]` AFTER resolve_smem

### Bug 9: F6xx instructions treated as NOP
- **Symptom**: MVDD (data-to-data move) silently dropped
- **Root cause**: F6xx handler only had cases for sub=2 and sub=6, rest fell to NOP
- **Fix**: Added MVDD for sub >= 0x8

### Bug 10: RPT/RPTB interaction
- **Symptom**: RPT inside RPTB causes infinite loop - RPTB redirect fires during RPT
- **Root cause**: RPTB check (`pc == rea + 1`) runs before exec and redirects PC during active RPT
- **Fix**: Skip RPTB check when `rpt_active` is true

### Bug 11: RPT F5xx return value
- **Symptom**: Changing RPT from `s->pc += 1; return 0` to `return 1` caused RPT to re-execute itself infinitely
- **Root cause**: RPT handler in main loop does `continue` (skips pc += consumed). With return 1, PC never advances past RPT instruction.
- **Fix**: Reverted to `s->pc += 1; return 0` - RPT must advance PC itself since the main loop's RPT handler will prevent further PC advance.

### Bug 12: NORM bit extraction
- **Symptom**: NORM checking wrong bits of accumulator
- **Root cause**: Was checking bits 31/30 of 24-bit masked value instead of bits 39/38 of 40-bit accumulator
- **Fix**: Changed to `(*acc >> 39) & 1` and `(*acc >> 38) & 1`

### Bug 13: L1CTL RESET_IND lost before client connects
- **Symptom**: ccch_scan connects but never receives RESET_IND
- **Root cause**: QEMU boots immediately, firmware sends RESET_IND before client is listening
- **Fix**: QEMU starts with `-S` (paused). `vm_start()` called when client connects.

### Bug 14: L1CTL reconnect stuck at "waiting for firmware"
- **Symptom**: Kill and relaunch mobile -> stuck at "waiting for firmware"
- **Root cause**: `cli_rx_enabled = false` on reconnect, firmware won't re-send RESET_IND
- **Fix**: On reconnect (VM already running), enable `cli_rx_enabled` immediately

### Bug 15: soft_to_int16 overflow in sercomm_udp.py
- **Symptom**: soft_bit=255 produces -33025 (outside int16 range)
- **Root cause**: No clamping
- **Fix**: `max(-32768, min(32767, ...))`

### Bug 16: Boot ROM at prog[0x0000-0x007F] empty
- **Symptom**: CALA to A(low)=0x0000 executes garbage (all zeros)
- **Root cause**: Internal Calypso boot ROM not in PROM dump. prog[0x0000] was uninitialized.
- **Fix**: Fill prog[0x0000-0x007F] with RET (0xF073) stubs

### Bug 17: Duplicate F0/F1 handler blocks
- **Symptom**: Second F0/F1 handler block is dead code, never reached
- **Root cause**: First `if (hi8 == 0xF0 || hi8 == 0xF1)` block catches everything
- **Status**: ✅ FIXÉ — le bloc dupliqué a été supprimé ; il ne reste qu'un seul handler `if (hi8 == 0xF0 || hi8 == 0xF1)` (calypso_c54x.c:5807). Nettoyage effectué.

### Bug 18: TINT0 timer scattered across files
- **Symptom**: Timer logic in calypso_trx.c mixed with DSP/ARM glue code
- **Root cause**: No dedicated timer module
- **Fix**: Created calypso_tint0.c/h as master clock module. Removed calypso_tdma_hw.c/h (slave, never connected).
